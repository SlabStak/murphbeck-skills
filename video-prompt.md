## PROMPT STRUCTURE

### Core Formula
```
[Subject] + [Action] + [Setting] + [Style] + [Camera]

Example:
"A golden retriever running through autumn leaves
in a sunlit forest, cinematic style, slow motion
tracking shot"
```

### Detailed Formula
```
[Subject description], [performing action],
in [environment/setting], [time of day/lighting],
[visual style], [camera movement], [mood/atmosphere]
```

---

## CAMERA MOVEMENTS

### Static Shots
```
static shot        - No camera movement
locked-off         - Tripod, completely still
```

### Movement Types
```

tilt up/down       - Vertical rotation
dolly in/out       - Move toward/away from subject
tracking shot      - Follow subject movement
crane shot         - Vertical lift movement
orbit/360          - Circle around subject
push in            - Slow zoom toward subject
pull out           - Move away from subject

steadicam          - Smooth following motion
```

### Dynamic Descriptions
```
"camera slowly pushes in on..."

"tracking alongside the..."
"smooth dolly shot following..."
"dramatic crane shot rising above..."
"POV shot moving through..."
```

---

## MOTION & TIMING

## COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Static/frozen | Unclear motion | Add explicit movement verbs |
| Wrong camera | Vague description | Specify exact camera movement |
| Too chaotic | Too many elements | Simplify, focus on one action |
| Wrong style | Style not specified | Add clear style keywords |
| Cut off action | Duration mismatch | Match action to video length |
| Unnatural physics | Impossible action | Describe realistic movement |

---

## VIDEO DURATION PLANNING

```
2-4 seconds:   Single action, simple loop
5-10 seconds:  Complete action sequence
10-20 seconds: Scene with development
20-60 seconds: Mini narrative (Sora)
60+ seconds:   Multiple scenes/cuts needed

Rule: Match prompt complexity to duration.
Shorter = simpler. Longer = more detail needed.
```
