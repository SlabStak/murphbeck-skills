## COGNITIVE BIAS CHECKS

### Common Biases to Check
```
CONFIRMATION BIAS
Are you only seeing evidence that supports
what you already believe?
Check: Actively seek contradicting information

SUNK COST FALLACY
Are you continuing because of past investment
rather than future value?
Check: Ignore past costs, focus on future outcomes

AVAILABILITY BIAS
Are you overweighting recent or memorable events?
Check: Look at base rates and statistical data

ANCHORING
Is your judgment overly influenced by the first
information you received?
Check: Start analysis fresh with new anchors

STATUS QUO BIAS
Are you avoiding change just because it's
unfamiliar?
Check: Evaluate all options equally

OVERCONFIDENCE
Are you too certain about your predictions?
Check: Consider the range of possible outcomes
```

### Bias-Busting Questions
```
• What would change your mind?
• What are you assuming that might not be true?
• Who disagrees with you and why?
• What would you advise someone else to do?
• What will you think looking back in 5 years?
```
