Day 0 - Home Value Delivery
Subject: Your Home Value Estimate for [Address]

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for requesting a home value estimate! I've analyzed your property and the local market.

...can significantly impact your actual sale price.

I'd love to provide a more accurate, in-person evaluation at no cost or obligation.
