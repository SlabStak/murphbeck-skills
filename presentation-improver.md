## CONTENT IMPROVEMENTS

### Simplification Techniques
```
REMOVE:
• Jargon and acronyms
• Unnecessary qualifiers ("very", "really")
• Hedging language ("I think", "maybe")
• Redundant information

ADD:
• Concrete examples
• Relevant stories
• Powerful pauses
• Clear transitions
```

### Data Presentation
```
BAD: "Our revenue increased from $1.2M to $1.8M
which represents a 50% growth rate over the
previous fiscal year period."

GOOD: "Revenue up 50% — from $1.2M to $1.8M."

Show the trend, say the insight.
Let the visual do the heavy lifting.
```

### Transition Phrases
```
SIGNPOSTING:
"Let's move to the second reason..."
"Now that we've covered X, let's look at Y..."

REINFORCING:
"This connects to what I mentioned earlier..."
"Here's why this matters..."

ENGAGING:
"You might be wondering..."
"Here's where it gets interesting..."
```

## DELIVERY TIPS

### Pacing
```
AVERAGE: 120-150 words per minute
EMPHASIS: Slow down for key points
PAUSE: After important statements
       Before major transitions
       To let data sink in
```

### Body Language
```
DO:
• Make eye contact (5-7 second rule)
• Use open gestures
• Move purposefully
• Smile appropriately

DON'T:
• Turn your back to read slides
• Stand behind podium entire time
• Fidget or sway
• Cross arms
```

### Voice
```
VARY:
• Volume (emphasis)
• Pace (interest)
• Pitch (emotion)
• Pauses (impact)

AVOID:
• Monotone delivery
• Filler words (um, uh, like)
• Upspeak (? at end of statements)
• Mumbling
```

### Handling Nerves
```
BEFORE:
• Deep breathing
• Power pose (2 minutes)
• Arrive early, get comfortable
• Know your opening cold

DURING:
• Focus on helping audience, not yourself
• Pause instead of using filler words
• Remember: audience wants you to succeed
• If lost, pause, breathe, continue
```

## Q&A PREPARATION

### Anticipate Questions
```
Categories to prepare:
• Challenges to your main points

```

### Handling Tough Questions
```
FRAMEWORK:
1. Listen fully (don't interrupt)
