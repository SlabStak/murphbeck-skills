## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC TIPS

### Midjourney
```
Best for: Abstract symbols, artistic logos
Add: "vector logo design" for clean output
Add: "white background" for easy editing
Use: --s 50-100 for cleaner designs
Avoid: Expecting perfect text (edit later)
```

### DALL-E 3
```
Best for: Conceptual exploration
Be very specific about style and elements
May need text refinement post-generation
Good for combination mark concepts
```

### Stable Diffusion
```
Use logo-specific LoRAs for best results
Add quality tags: "vector, scalable, professional"
Use negative prompts to remove complexity
Consider multiple generations and combining
```

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Scalability
```
